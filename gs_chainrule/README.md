This lecture deals with the relationship between the chain rule and using the nonlinear block Gauss-Siedel (NLBGS) algorithm to solve the unified derivative equations. 

The code snippet in simple_gs.py gives you a simple toy problem that you can use to play around with the NLBGS algorithm shown in the lecture.
